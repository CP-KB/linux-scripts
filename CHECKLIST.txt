Windows/Ubuntu Security Checklist

*** Windows *** reminder different versions will have different things/ways to check
	
	Comparison to standard image
	Give all users proper privileges
	Remove unusual/rogue users
	Set proper user settings (pass expire, etc)
		Allow password to expire
	Set password requirements
		Min length=10
		Max age=90
		Min age=?
		
	Set account lockout settings
	Disable unnecessary services
	Disable unnecessary startup applications (msconfig)
	Disable remote desktop connections (or at least don't allow unsecure)
	Check for and remove malware/unneeded applications
	Check for and remove `hacking` applications (ophcrack, hashcat, cain & abel, etc)
	Set security policies (secpol.msc)
	Configure firewall properly
	Configure updates properly
	Delete non work/unnecessary files like music, videos, personal junk (insecure)
		find/locate *.mp3 *.mp4 *.jpg *.png *.txt passwords.txt
	Check Registry for wierd entries
	
*** Linux	***

	Comparison to standard image
	Check for newer date of files compared to when os may have been installed
	Check for unauthorized users (/etc/passwd)
	Check the groups that users are in (/etc/group)
	Disable unneeded/unsecure services (bum, services)
	Look for unsecure configurations in /etc/
	Look for interesting logs in /var/log/
	Make sure firewall is configured properly and running (ufw, gufw)
	Check file permissions (ex. file in /home/bob/ owned by joe with group of root)
	Look for suspicious software/packages and remove
	Look for and remove `hacking` software
	Set password requirements
	Set account lockout requirements
	Setup login page correctly
	Check the header of unknown files (is "message" actually a zip or a pdf)
	Disable use of root user (only use sudo)
	Nmap for open ports on localhost
	Update unsecure/old software
	Check running processes for suspicious activity
	
	
*** TODO LINUX/WINDOWS SCRIPT/PROGRAM ***

	Compare filesystem
	Parse /etc/passwd and /etc/group
	Auto locate executables in home directories
	Search packages for known list of hacking tools
	Compare packages with fresh install packages
	
	
***	IDEAS

	Create a program that runs in ubuntu or any Linux distro
	which does the analysis on a read only copy of an OSs fs.
	A report is generated with suggested fixes. Each has ch-
	eck boxes to decide which are to be done. The program 
	running in the host generates a bash script to do the ch-
	anges that were selected. It can also generate a bash
	script to undo the selected changes.
	
		Example. Run script to change. Check points.
		If points lost, undo the options that didn't
		gain points.
			(maybe the app can zip up the removed files so
			 that they can be put back into place if need
			 be)
	
	This program should be able to do checks in any type of
	Linux distro or Windows version. Possibly for Windows
	a batch script or powershell script could be generated.
	Even maybe a g++ compiled binary that does what is required by
	using c++ code created on the fly from rules in the scanning app.
	
	
	
	There may be registry tools and parsing tools out there for
	windows configurations and linux configurations. Maybe
	these could be incorporated into the app.
	
	
	Ultimately, the app needs so many rules, that there will be
	barely anything that the app doesn't check. I suggest that
	there should be an easy way of adding rules/parsers for when
	there are newer versions of os's or new hacking software to
	look for. Maybe a database. XML, SQL not sure.

	It would be nice to have cross platform GUI - wxWidgets or Qt could work,
however I like the license for wxWidgets better.
